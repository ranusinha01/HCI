Securing payment info using md5,SHA and encryption methods.

Today, digitalization decisively penetrates all the sides of the modern society. Oneof the key enablers to maintain this process secure is authentication.
It covers many different areas of a hyper-connected world, including online payments, communications, access right management, etc.
This work sheds light on the evolution of authentication systems towards Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) starting from Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) and through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
In this project we build a website with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. User can authenticate himself with the help of username and password. Afterwards his personal details like email and password are stored in highly secured database.
For database security we have used various encryption methods like md5 and SHA. We have used bcrypt to convert password into hash along with ten salting rounds. It’s a one way process which makesit impossible for a hacker to get the password and other details.
Also we did the penetration testing, sql injection using burpsuite, skipfish , whatweb , wpscan and legion etc.
